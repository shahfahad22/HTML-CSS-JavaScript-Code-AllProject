            Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
            content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
            such as JavaScript, a programming language.

            Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying
            the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup
            language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
            core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
            Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side
            for webpage behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
            engine that executes the client code.

            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
            environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
            Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript
            code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript
            to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.
